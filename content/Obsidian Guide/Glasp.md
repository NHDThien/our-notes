I posted [how to export highlighted sentences on web articles into Obsidian with Glasp 13](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/copy-and-paste-all-sentences-i-want-in-a-web-article-at-once-on-obsidian/30022) before and [How to import Kindle Notes & Highlights as MD file 5](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/how-to-import-kindle-notes-highlights-as-md-file/44400) yesterday.

Today, I’ll show my workflow for extracting YouTube video transcripts with [Glasp 55](https://glasp.co/)! It helps me cut down the time to writing down what people speak in the YouTube video. It’s a big saving of time.

Once you install the Chrome extension, it fetches the transcript from the YouTube video, so you can just copy it. Then, I can paste it on Obsidian. If I want, I can see transcripts in other languages.

To show and copy the transcript, you don’t need to create an account with Glasp. Just a Chrome extension.

But with the Glasp account, I can highlight the Youtube transcripts. Then, I can only export the highlighted transcripts.

And if I copy-n-paste only the highlighted transcript on Obsidian, it’s shown like below.

It’s markdown style by default. So, it’s useful and saves my time a lot! Hope it helps you as well

Another way, with no accounts or extensions needed:

1.  select ‘show transcripts’
2.  toggle ‘timestamps’ as needed
3.  copy and paste the transcript as needed

Hi Klaas, thanks for the comment and sorry for the confusion.  
What I meant was to copy-n-paste transcript, you don’t need to sign up. But if you want to highlight, you need to sign up because they create a profile page where all of your highlights are accumulated.

Thank you, eightning!  
Yeah, I know this way, too! But with that way, the sentences are cut in short and I need to edit them which is cumbersome for me.
