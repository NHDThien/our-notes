`Wikipedia`
[Personal knowledge management - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_knowledge_management)
Personal knowledge management (PKM) is **a process** of ==collecting== information that a person uses to ==gather==, ==classify==, ==store==, ==search==, ==retrieve== and ==share== knowledge in their daily activities (Grundspenkis 2007) and the way in which these ==processes support work activities== (Wright 2005). It is a response to the idea that knowledge workers need to be responsible for their own growth and learning (Smedley 2009). It is a **bottom-up approach** to knowledge management (KM) (Pollard 2008).
